"Crawling"

        [Chester Bennington:]
        Crawling in my skin
        These wounds they will not heal
        Fear is how I fall
        Confusing what is real
        
        There's something inside me that pulls beneath the surface
        Consuming confusing
        This lack of self-control I fear is never ending
        Controlling I can't seem
        
        [Chester Bennington (Mike Shinoda):]
        To find myself again
        My walls are closing in
        (without a sense of confidence and I'm convinced that there's just too much pressure to take)
        I've felt this way before
        So insecure
