<pre>"Don't Stay"

        Sometimes I need to remember just to breathe
        Sometimes I need you to stay away from me
        Sometimes I'm in disbelief I didn't know
        Somehow I need you to go
        
        Don't stay
        Forget our memories
        Forget our possibilities
        What you were changing me into
        (Just give me myself back and)
        Don't stay
        Forget our memories
        Forget our possibilities
        Take all your faithlessness with you
        Just give me myself back and
        Don't stay</pre>
