<pre>"Runaway"

        [Chester Bennington (Mike Shinoda):]
        Graffiti decorations
        Under a sky of dust
        A constant wave of tension
        On top of broken trust
        The lessons that you taught me
        I learn were never true
        Now I find myself in question
        (They point the finger at me again)
        Guilty by association
        (You point the finger at me again)</pre>
